# Space_B__ars
This is a game made on Python, and runs on the PyGame libraries. 

All the rogue keys have escaped your keyboard, except the loyal "Space_B__ar".
Use the spacebar to capture all of the other keys. Remember, if you try to capture an already captured key, it will escape, and so, avoid trying to capture the spacebar at all costs or face the consequenses.

The keys that you have captured can be used to form commands, which help you capture the other keys. So, you could use the command "slow" to slow down the stream of characters. And yes, even to save the game, use the command "save"; so, you know what to do ðŸ˜‰.

The main idea behind the game is to make it an expansive user-modded game. Thus, one of the goals is to have a large list of commands that the user can execute, and must explore to find out.
Some of the commands that have been thought of are - protect, reverse, slow, save, wildcard etc.
The player will not be knowing which all commands exist in the game, but rather be expected to try out the different words that can be formed with the available keys, and see what happens and works.
